# ShortestPathAlgorithm
Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm not using a 2-dimensional array to represent the nodes and edges.

The graph may have a few nodes but there are multiple edges between nodes.
This call for a different representation.
I am considering to eliminate redundant edges by keeping the shortest.
With that in mind, I will write a solution.
